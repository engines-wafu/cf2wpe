# cf2wpe
A script to create waypoint editor input files.

## Dependencies
This script assumes you are using [Combat Flite](https://www.combatflite.com/) and the latest alpha of [DCS Waypoint Editor](https://github.com/Santi871/DCSWaypointEditor/releases/tag/v1.0.0b1).  To run the script you will need either [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) or Matlab, although the latter has not been tested.

## Installation
Download the cf2wpe.m file to your local computer and open with Octave.  Run the script using either the graphical user interface or command line interface.

## Usage
Create a Combat Flight mission with a flight containing the desired waypoints.  Aircraft type, numbers, and configuration are not important.  When the route is complete use the "Export.dat" command on the "File" ribbon to create a data file for the desired flight.

Note that only the waypoints are to be exported.

Click "Export" then "OK".  At the dialogue, navigate to the folder containing the cf2wpe.m script and save the file.  You may leave the filename as the default.

At this point you can open Octave and run the script.  It will ask for the input file name for the .dat file you just created.  Hit "Enter" and a .json file will be created with a filename in the following format `cf2wpe-yyyymmdd-####.json` where `yyyymmmdd` is the date and `####` is a unique 4 digit has generated by the input file.

Open DCS Waypoint Editor and select the "Profile" drop down menu then select "Import" and "Load from encoded file".  Navigate to the location of the script and select the generated  .json file.

DCS Waypoint Editor should now be ready to input the navigation data into the aircraft for you.

## Limitations
This has only been tested using the Harrier input preset, but there is no reason to assume this won't work on other types by overwriting the aircraft type field in the DCS Waypoint Editor user interface.
